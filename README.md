I’m Rahul, a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering. When I applied to college, I didn’t have perfect stats, a private counselor, or Ivy League connections. But I learned how to write essays that *made people care*. That skill helped me land research positions, get into grad school, and earn scholarships. Now I help students do the same, by turning their life stories into powerful essays that actually stand out.

## ❓ FAQs

**How do I send my essay?**  
After you book, email your draft to rahulthinks42@gmail.com and include a few sentences about your goals (schools you're applying to, what you're trying to convey, etc.). This helps me tailor the feedback to your story and application strategy.

**Do you help with UC PIQs or Common App?**  
Yes, just let me know what you're working on. I edit personal statements, supplements, and PIQs.

**Do you offer ongoing coaching?**  
Yes, if you want additional support, we can build a custom package together.

**Do you guarantee admission?**  
No one can. But I *can* guarantee you’ll feel more confident and proud of your writing after we work together.
